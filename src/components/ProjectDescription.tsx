          I developed a Reinforcement Learning agent to play Pong using deep
          Q-learning techniques. <br></br> The agent was trained to improve its
          performance over time, achieving competitive gameplay. Additionally, I
          built a custom web interface that allows users to play against the
          trained agent directly in their browser, providing an interactive and
          engaging experience. The project showcases my expertise in machine
          learning, game development, and web technologies.
